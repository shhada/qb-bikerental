# qb-bikerental

Rent bikes using qb-target and nh-contextmenu/qb-menu,
converted from [Night_bikes](https://github.com/nighmares/Night_bikes)

(first convert ever, pls go easy on me)

Dependencies:
* [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core)
* [qb-target](https://github.com/BerkieBb/qb-target)
* [nh-context](https://github.com/nerohiro/nh-context) or [qb-menu](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-menu)
* [Electric Sharing Scooter](https://www.gta5-mods.com/vehicles/portuguese-electric-sharing-scooter-addon-livery-map-editor-xml) (already added in the stream folder)
* [ped-spawner](https://github.com/sjpfeiffer/ped_spawner)

set the price for the bikes in the config (default: $150)


Add to qb-target under Config.TargetModels:
```
    ["bikerental"] = {
        models = {
            `ig_maryann`,
        },
        options = {
            {
                type = "client",
                event = "Night:rented",
                icon = "fas fa-bicycle",
                label = "Rent a Bike",
            },
        },
        distance = 3.0
    },
```

Add to ped-spawner under Config.Pedlist:
```
-- Bike Rental
    {
		model = `ig_maryann`,
		coords = vector3(-208.46, -1010.08, 29.19), -- Alta St
		heading = 72.95, 
		gender = 'female',
		animDict = "amb@world_human_jog_standing@female@idle_a", 
		animName = "idle_a",
    },
```

If you're using qb-menu instead of nh-context, replace the TriggerEvent to open/create the menu
In older versions of nh-context it's `'nh-context:sendMenu'`, in newer versions it should be `'nh-context:createMenu'`
In qb-menu it's `'qb-menu:client:openMenu'`


## TODO
* add vehicles to config
* add custom price per vehicle
